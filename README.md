[Project 1: Revenue and ratings for apple apps]() 

This project focuses on using SQL to analyze revenue and user ratings data for Apple apps. We'll gather and clean the dataset, then explore key questions like identifying top-grossing apps, assessing the correlation between ratings and revenue, and tracking category-based performance. Visualizations will help convey our findings, offering valuable insights for app development and marketing decisions. Remember to handle data responsibly and ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
